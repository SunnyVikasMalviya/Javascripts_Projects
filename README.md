<h1>Timed-Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
Same old game of Tik-Tac-Toe with slight catch. All the moves will be timed and a player will have to move within a certain amount of time (say 5 seconds), else the opponent will be declared as the winner. Also, after a certain amount of time of a particular move being played (say 30 seconds), the move will be removed from the playing map and the button will be again made available for making a move by both the players.<br/>A mobile version of the game was developed(pics attached below). The pictures show how moves disappear after a while for a new move.
